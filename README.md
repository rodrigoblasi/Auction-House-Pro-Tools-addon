**Author:** Blasi

## General Description

Auction House Pro Tools is an addon developed for **World of Warcraft** players who want to enhance their experience with the **Auction House**. This addon is a toolbox that complements the functionalities of other widely used addons, such as **TradeSkillMaster** and **Auctionator**, without replacing any of these tools. Its focus is to provide additional support and useful insights for players who want to optimize their trading transactions.

The goal of **Auction House Pro Tools** is to make buying and selling decisions more efficient by offering a broader view of Auction House activities. Designed for more experienced players, it provides specific tools for sales analysis, undercutting strategies, and other important aspects of the market.

## Objectives and Features

**Auction House Pro Tools** is a modular tool, meaning each functionality is implemented as an independent module. This allows users to choose which features they want to activate, offering greater flexibility. The current modules are:

- **Sales Summary Extended**: Provides a detailed summary of sales made in the Auction House, offering additional data to help players understand their trading activities and identify improvement opportunities.

- **Undercut Wars Helper**: Assists players in undercutting wars by offering alerts and recommendations on when to adjust item prices to stay competitive and not lose sales to competitors.

Each module can be activated or deactivated as desired, allowing full control over the addon's features.

## Addon Scope

- **Complementarity**: Auction House Pro Tools is designed to be a complement, not a replacement, for other popular Auction House addons.
- **Simplicity and Flexibility**: Despite offering advanced features, the approach is to ensure that the resources are easy to use and flexible for different player profiles.
- **Strategic Assistance**: Focused on players who take the game's economy seriously, offering tools that help maximize profit and understand market behavior.

## Current Project Status

Currently, the addon is at **version 0.0.1** and includes initial functionalities that aim to lay the foundation for future growth. It is being developed with a focus on simplicity and efficiency, with the intention of continuously receiving new features and improvements.
